# Release Gate: ga-dvvsla-5

Status: FAIL

Source bead: ga-dvvsla.5
Deploy bead: ga-risrqo
Branch: builder/ga-dvvsla-5
Commit: c5ece0fb25a97e236608905119ce11ed7985aa0a
Base checked: origin/main at ef7fb4f1e22ff696086c96033e66dc003ef7b9c9

`docs/PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` is not present in this worktree, so this gate uses
the deployer role's release criteria table plus the repo testing policy in
`TESTING.md`.

## Criteria

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Review PASS present | PASS | `bd show ga-risrqo` contains `Review verdict: PASS` for branch `builder/ga-dvvsla-5`. |
| 2 | Acceptance criteria met | PASS | Review notes confirm controller startup invokes the migration before reconcile, the migration copies and clears lifecycle metadata through the designed paths, the idempotence marker is used, and per-bead errors continue without aborting the remaining attempts. |
| 3 | Tests pass | FAIL | Release-gate tests were not run because criterion 6 failed before a clean final branch could be evaluated. Builder/reviewer notes report prior focused tests, `go test ./...`, `make test-fast-parallel`, and `go vet ./...` passed on the stale branch. |
| 4 | No high-severity review findings open | PASS | Review notes list LOW/INFO findings only; no HIGH or CRITICAL findings are present. |
| 5 | Final branch is clean | PASS | `git status --short --branch` was clean before writing this gate file; this gate file is committed as the only deployer change on the feature branch. |
| 6 | Branch diverges cleanly from main | FAIL | `git merge-tree origin/main origin/builder/ga-dvvsla-5` reported content conflicts in `cmd/gc/error_store.go`, `internal/api/handler_beads_test.go`, `internal/beads/bdstore.go`, `internal/beads/beads.go`, `internal/beads/beadstest/conformance.go`, `internal/beads/caching_store_writes.go`, `internal/beads/exec/exec.go`, and `internal/beads/memstore.go`. |

## Failure Diagnosis

The prior blocker PR #2309 has merged into `origin/main`, but this downstream
branch still carries the older transactional-write stack below the local
metadata work. The deployer must not resolve content conflicts or rebase release
branches, so this bead is routed back to builder for a rebuild on current
`origin/main`.
