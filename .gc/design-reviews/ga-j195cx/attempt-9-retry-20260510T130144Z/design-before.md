| Supersedes | `contract = "graph.v2"` as the user-facing formula compiler requirement |

Design for replacing the formula `contract` field with an explicit
requirements table that declares the minimum formula compiler capability a
formula needs.

## Problem

Formula v2 currently uses:

```toml
formula = "code-review-loop"
version = 2
contract = "graph.v2"
```

This mixes three separate ideas:

- formula artifact revision
- formula file/compiler compatibility
- the current graph compiler implementation name

After review, formula artifact revision should not live on individual formula
files. The existing integer `version` field should not be repurposed into
formula semver. Formulas are distributed through packs, and pack version, pack
ref, or pack commit SHA is the durable way to identify the exact authored
workflow a consumer is using.

That leaves the current `contract` field. Its real purpose is not to describe a
runtime contract and not to select a compiler at execution time. It is a
minimum requirement: this formula uses constructs that require a compiler with
formula-v2 capability.

## Goals

1. Give formulas a standard way to declare minimum compiler requirements.
2. Make clear that formulas do not select the compiler implementation.
3. Remove formula-level artifact versioning from the design.
4. Preserve pack-level version/ref/SHA as the consistency mechanism for formula
   consumers.
5. Keep the current `[daemon] formula_v2` feature flag as the operator opt-in
   for formula-v2 compilation.
6. Provide a migration path from `contract = "graph.v2"` without breaking
   existing formulas immediately.

## Non-Goals

- Versioning individual formulas independently from their containing pack.
- Adding runtime compiler selection.
- Adding multiple formula compiler implementations.
- Changing formula layer resolution or filename-based shadowing.
- Changing pack semver, pack imports, or remote pinning behavior.

## Decision

Add a top-level `[requires]` table to formula files:

```toml
formula = "code-review-loop"

[requires]
formula_compiler = ">=2"
```

`requires.formula_compiler` declares the minimum formula compiler capability
needed to parse and compile the formula. It is a requirement expression, not a
selector.

The active Gas City binary decides which compiler path to use. For v0, the
mapping is simple:

| Requirement | Meaning |
|---|---|
| omitted | Formula only requires the default compiler capability |
| `>=2` | Formula requires formula-v2 graph compiler capability |

If `[daemon] formula_v2 = false`, a formula requiring compiler capability `>=2`
must fail with an actionable error that tells the operator to enable
`[daemon] formula_v2` or use a formula that does not require compiler v2.

## Why `requires`

`requires` is the standard package/config term for constraints that must be
satisfied by the host toolchain. It communicates the important boundary:

- the formula declares what it needs
- the host decides whether it can satisfy that need
- the formula does not choose the compiler at execution time

This is more precise than `contract`, which sounds like an interface agreement,
and more precise than `schema`, which suggests the physical file format.

## Formula Artifact Versioning

Formula files should not carry their own semver field.

Consumers who need consistency should pin the containing pack:

- by semver when using a released pack version
- by tag or branch when appropriate
- by commit SHA when exact reproducibility matters

This keeps the existing pack model as the single distribution and revision
boundary. A formula's identity remains its resolved formula name and winning
file in the formula layer stack. Its authored revision is the pack revision
that provided that winning file.

## Proposed TOML Surface

### Default compiler capability

```toml
formula = "simple-review"

[[steps]]
id = "review"
title = "Review the change"
description = "..."
```

No `[requires]` table means the formula can compile with the default formula
compiler capability.

### Formula-v2 compiler capability

```toml
formula = "code-review-loop"

[requires]
formula_compiler = ">=2"

[[steps]]
id = "review"
title = "Review the change"
description = "..."

[steps.retry]
max_attempts = 3
on_exhausted = "soft_fail"
```

The exact v2-only fields are validated by the formula package. If a formula uses
v2-only constructs without declaring `requires.formula_compiler = ">=2"`,
validation should fail with a direct message that names the missing requirement.

## Requirement Expression

V0 supports only the expression forms needed for current formula compiler
capabilities. The parser must reject every other value instead of accepting a
future range optimistically.

| Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| omitted | Default compiler capability, equivalent to `>=1` |
| `>=1` | Default compiler capability |
| `>=2` | Formula-v2 graph compiler capability |

Resolved public syntax choices:

- Exact `formula_compiler = "2"` is not accepted in v0.
- `">= 2"`, `" >=2"`, `">=2 "`, `">=2.0"`, `">=2.1"`, and `">=3"` are not
  accepted in v0.
- `requires.formula_compiler` must be a TOML string. Integer, float, boolean,
  array, table, and dotted-table values fail validation.
- An omitted `[requires]` table and an empty `[requires]` table both mean the
  default compiler capability.
- Unknown keys under `[requires]` fail validation. `formula_compiler` is the
  only supported requirement axis in v0.

Future compiler capability expressions can be added only by extending this
grammar and its validation matrix in the same change.

## Parser And Validation Contract

<!-- REVIEW: added per parser-validation-semantics -->

Requirement validation is owned by `internal/formula` and runs before any
caller creates beads, wisps, or workflow roots. The deterministic diagnostic
order is:

1. TOML decoding errors.
2. Unknown `[requires]` keys and invalid TOML types.
3. Unsupported `requires.formula_compiler` expressions.
4. Legacy `contract` normalization and `contract`/`requires` conflicts.
5. Missing compiler requirement for v2-only constructs.
6. Host capability failures such as `[daemon] formula_v2 = false`.

The v0 v2-only construct registry is:

| Construct | Locations scanned |
|---|---|
| Step `check` and legacy internal `ralph` | `steps`, `children`, `loop.body`, expansion `template` |
| Step `retry` | `steps`, `children`, `loop.body`, expansion `template` |
| Step `on_complete` | `steps`, `children`, `loop.body`, expansion `template` |
| Graph workflow metadata keys | `steps`, `children`, `loop.body`, expansion `template` |
| Graph workflow metadata values | `gc.kind` values `scope`, `cleanup`, `scope-check`, `workflow-finalize`, `retry`, `retry-run`, `retry-eval`, `ralph`, `run`, and `check` |
| Graph workflow metadata keys | `gc.scope_name`, `gc.scope_role`, `gc.scope_ref`, `gc.continuation_group`, and `gc.on_fail` |

`needs`, `depends_on`, `children`, `loop`, `gate`, `condition`,
`compose.expand`, `compose.map`, and `compose.aspects` are not v2-only by
themselves in this design. They require compiler v2 only when the resolved
formula, expansion, aspect, or nested body also contains one of the v2-only
constructs above.

Normalization rules:

- Requirements are normalized after formula layer resolution and inheritance,
  before control-flow, expansion, retry, Ralph, and graph-control transforms.
- Parent requirements are inherited like the current `contract` field. A child
  may raise the requirement, but it may not lower a parent requirement.
- Inline children and `loop.body` inherit the containing formula's normalized
  requirement because they have no independent formula header.
- Expansion and aspect formulas are parsed and normalized independently. The
  compiled root requirement is the maximum requirement of the root formula and
  every expansion or aspect that contributed steps.
- If a formula, expansion, or aspect contains a v2-only construct but does not
  declare `requires.formula_compiler = ">=2"` or legacy `contract = "graph.v2"`,
  validation fails at that source formula with a diagnostic that names the
  missing requirement.

The implementation must add table-driven tests for accepted strings, rejected
strings, invalid TOML types, unknown `[requires]` keys, empty tables, legacy
contract compatibility, conflicts, missing requirements, inherited
requirements, expansion/aspect aggregation, loop bodies, children, and
unsupported future requirements.

## Canonical Compile Result

<!-- REVIEW: added per canonical-requirement-ownership -->

`internal/formula` is the only package that may interpret raw `contract`,
`requires.formula_compiler`, `version`, or v2-only construct strings. All
behavioral callers must consume a normalized compile result.

The required internal shape is:

```go
type CompilerCapability int

const (
    CompilerCapabilityDefault CompilerCapability = 1
    CompilerCapabilityGraphV2  CompilerCapability = 2
)

type RequirementSource string

const (
    RequirementSourceOmitted  RequirementSource = "omitted"
    RequirementSourceRequires RequirementSource = "requires"
    RequirementSourceContract RequirementSource = "contract"
    RequirementSourceDual     RequirementSource = "dual"
)

type NormalizedRequirements struct {
    FormulaCompiler CompilerCapability
    Source          RequirementSource
    SourceFormula   string
    SourcePath      string
    Deprecated      bool
}

type Diagnostic struct {
    Code                  string
    Severity              string
    Formula               string
    SourcePath            string
    SourceKey             string
    SourceValue           string
    NormalizedRequirement string
    HostCapability        string
    Message               string
    Remediation           string
    OnceKey               string
}

type CompileResult struct {
    Recipe       *Recipe
    Requirements NormalizedRequirements
    GraphWorkflow bool
    Diagnostics  []Diagnostic
    Provenance   Provenance
}
```

The public compile path may keep a convenience `Compile(...) (*Recipe, error)`
wrapper, but callers that branch on graph behavior, project diagnostics, create
workflow roots, or stamp metadata must use `CompileResult`. `Recipe` may carry
the normalized fields for instantiation, but it must not force consumers to
re-parse raw TOML strings.

Caller inventory and required replacement behavior:

| Surface | Current risk | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/formula` parser, validation, and graph transforms | Raw `Contract` and `declaresGraphV2Contract` are load-bearing | Replace with `NormalizedRequirements` and `GraphWorkflow` |
| `internal/molecule` cook/cook-on and graph apply | Root metadata can be stamped from raw contract | Stamp from `CompileResult` only |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go` and `internal/sling` routing helpers | Graph routing and workflow attachment can branch on `gc.formula_contract` | Use shared workflow-root predicates backed by normalized metadata |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_order.go` and `cmd/gc/order_dispatch.go` | Order wisps can emit divergent errors | Preflight with `CompileResult`; emit the shared diagnostic event on failure |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_convoy_dispatch.go` and convoy cleanup | Graph-only roots can be discovered by legacy metadata only | Use shared workflow-root predicate that accepts new and legacy metadata during migration |
| `internal/api/handler_sling.go`, formula endpoints, order feeds, and convoy projections | HTTP status and dashboard-facing errors can diverge | Project `Diagnostic` without hand-written JSON or string parsing |
| `internal/convergence` formula subset | Subset validation can drift from full compiler semantics | Validate through `internal/formula` preflight or an adapter over `CompileResult` |
| Dashboard generated types | UI can infer graph state from legacy metadata | Use API-projected typed fields and diagnostics |

CI must include a static guard that fails on new behavioral uses of raw
`contract = "graph.v2"`, `declaresGraphV2Contract`, `Requires.FormulaCompiler`,
or `gc.formula_contract` outside the parser, compatibility metadata writer,
shared workflow-root predicate, tests, fixtures, and docs.

## Compatibility With `contract`

<!-- REVIEW: added per migration-compatibility-contract -->

`contract = "graph.v2"` is a deprecated compatibility alias for:

```toml
[requires]
formula_compiler = ">=2"
```

V0 behavior:

- If only `contract = "graph.v2"` is present, compile as
  `requires.formula_compiler = ">=2"` and emit `formula.contract_deprecated`.
- If both are present and agree, compile and emit
  `formula.contract_deprecated`.
- If both are present and disagree, fail validation with
  `formula.compiler_requirement_conflict`.
- If `contract` has any value other than `graph.v2`, fail validation.
- The warning must preserve the source spelling and point to the exact
  replacement:

```text
contract = "graph.v2" is deprecated; use [requires] formula_compiler = ">=2"
```

Compatibility matrix:

| Formula source | Old binary that only knows `contract` | New binary with `formula_v2 = false` | New binary with `formula_v2 = true` |
|---|---|---|---|
| No requirement and no v2-only constructs | Works | Works | Works |
| `contract = "graph.v2"` | Works when old graph support is enabled | Fails with `formula.compiler_requirement_unsatisfied` | Works with deprecation warning |
| Dual `contract` plus `[requires] formula_compiler = ">=2"` | Works because old binary reads `contract` | Fails with `formula.compiler_requirement_unsatisfied` | Works with deprecation warning |
| `[requires] formula_compiler = ">=2"` only | Not supported for v2 formulas; old binary can miss the requirement | Fails with `formula.compiler_requirement_unsatisfied` | Works |
| Unsupported future requirement such as `>=3` | Not supported | Fails with unsupported requirement | Fails with unsupported requirement |

First-party built-in and example graph formulas must stay dual-declared until
the minimum supported Gas City binary understands `[requires]` and either the
native compiler path is the only production path or the `bd` shell-out path is
proven to accept equivalent requirements. External SHA-pinned formulas that use
legacy `contract = "graph.v2"` remain valid through the alias window.

The alias window is not time-based. The release captain for this migration may
remove legacy `contract` support only after all of these are true:

1. Every first-party pack, example, test fixture, and tutorial has shipped with
   `[requires]` for at least two minor releases.
2. `gc formula validate --all-packs --legacy-contract-report` reports zero
   first-party legacy-only formulas.
3. The release checklist records that externally pinned legacy formulas remain
   supported by either the alias or a documented compatibility branch.
4. CI's stale-guidance check rejects new docs that teach `contract` as the
   canonical surface.

## Host Capability And Diagnostics

<!-- REVIEW: added per operator-diagnostics-projection -->

`[daemon] formula_v2` remains the host capability gate. A formula whose
normalized requirement is `CompilerCapabilityGraphV2` must fail before creating
any new runtime state when the host capability is disabled.

Required diagnostic codes:

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `formula.requirement_unknown_axis` | error | `[requires]` contains an unsupported key |
| `formula.requirement_invalid_type` | error | A requirement value has the wrong TOML type |
| `formula.compiler_requirement_unsupported` | error | The expression is not supported in v0 |
| `formula.compiler_requirement_conflict` | error | `contract` and `[requires]` disagree |
| `formula.compiler_requirement_missing` | error | A v2-only construct lacks a v2 requirement |
| `formula.compiler_requirement_unsatisfied` | error | Host config cannot satisfy the normalized requirement |
| `formula.contract_deprecated` | warning | Legacy `contract` spelling was accepted |
| `formula.version_deprecated` | warning | Legacy formula `version` was present and preserved only as metadata |

Projection rules:

- CLI commands that compile formulas print warnings to stderr once per
  `(code, source path, source key)` per command invocation. Fatal diagnostics
  exit non-zero and include the code, source path, offending value, normalized
  requirement, host capability, and remediation.
- API endpoints return typed diagnostic fields in Huma-registered response
  bodies. User-correctable formula input errors use HTTP 400; internal I/O
  failures remain HTTP 500.
- Dashboard state is derived from the API diagnostic projection, not by parsing
  stderr or root metadata strings.
- Order dispatch emits one typed order failure event per failed dispatch
  attempt and continues scanning later orders. Repeated deprecation warnings
  use `OnceKey` suppression and must not flood the event bus.
- Controller and convergence paths wrap the same `Diagnostic` code and fields
  in their existing error/event surfaces. They must not synthesize alternate
  wording that loses the remediation.
- Deprecation warnings are diagnostics attached to the compile result. CLI,
  API, dashboard, and controller projections decide whether and where to show
  them, but they all preserve the same code and source spelling.

## Persisted Metadata And Provenance

<!-- REVIEW: added per metadata-provenance-contract -->

Workflow roots created from compiler-v2 formulas must be dual-stamped during
the compatibility window:

| Metadata key | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `gc.formula_compiler_requirement` | `>=2` | Canonical |
| `gc.formula_requirement_source` | `requires`, `contract`, or `dual` | Canonical |
| `gc.formula_compiler_capability` | `2` | Canonical |
| `gc.formula_contract` | `graph.v2` | Deprecated compatibility stamp |

New producers must write the canonical keys. During the alias window they also
write `gc.formula_contract = "graph.v2"` for graph workflow roots so existing
readers continue to work. New consumers must use a shared predicate that reads
canonical metadata first and falls back to the legacy key only for compatibility.

Formula validation must expose a read-only provenance surface before built-in
packs are migrated:

```bash
gc formula validate <name> --provenance
gc formula validate --all-packs --provenance
```

This command must not create or update beads. It reports:

- formula name and winning source file
- formula layer and pack binding that won resolution
- pack import source, ref, and locked revision when available
- local path imports as `local` with a content hash and dirty status when the
  path is under a VCS checkout
- local path imports outside a VCS checkout as `local-not-reproducibly-pinned`
- deprecated fields, invalid requirements, v2-only constructs, and normalized
  compiler requirement

`version` remains accepted as legacy input for now. It is preserved only as
legacy metadata and may produce `formula.version_deprecated` on user-facing
validation paths. It is not a compiler selector and not a formula artifact
version.

## Rollout Plan

<!-- REVIEW: added per reversible-rollout -->

Rollout is split so `main` can stay green and each phase has a narrow rollback.

1. Parser and model: add `Requires`, `NormalizedRequirements`, diagnostics, and
   validation tests. Keep existing callers on current behavior.
2. Compile result and metadata: add `CompileResult`, canonical metadata keys,
   dual-stamping, and the shared workflow-root predicate. Existing legacy
   consumers still work through the fallback.
3. Caller migration: move sling, orders, API, convoy, convergence, molecule,
   dashboard projections, and tests to the normalized result and shared
   diagnostics. Add the static no-raw-consumer guard.
4. Compatibility bridge: keep first-party graph formulas dual-declared while
   any supported production path can still shell out to a compiler that only
   understands `contract`.
5. Docs and examples: after parser and caller support ships, update
   `docs/reference/formula.md`, architecture docs, tutorials, examples,
   testdata, config references, and generated CLI docs to teach `[requires]` as
   canonical. Legacy `contract` appears only in migration notes.
6. First-party requires-only conversion: remove first-party `contract` stamps
   only after the minimum binary floor is enforced and the `bd` compatibility
   strategy is complete.
7. Alias removal: remove legacy `contract` support only after the measurable
   alias-window criteria above pass.

Rollback notes:

- Phases 1 and 2 are additive and can be reverted without changing formula
  source files.
- Phase 3 can fall back to legacy predicates because roots are dual-stamped.
- Phase 4 keeps dual source declarations, so old binaries still read built-in
  graph formulas.
- Phases 6 and 7 require an explicit release decision because they can affect
  externally pinned packs.

## In-Flight And Convergence Behavior

<!-- REVIEW: added per in-flight-convergence-behavior -->

Compiler requirements are evaluated when a formula is compiled for a new root,
wisp, attached molecule, expansion, or convergence instance. They are not
re-evaluated for already-created beads that are merely being observed,
dispatched, retried, closed, or finalized.

Rules:

- If `[daemon] formula_v2` changes from true to false, existing graph workflow
  roots and their already-created step beads continue through dispatcher,
  retry, scope-check, convoy cleanup, and workflow-finalize paths using their
  persisted metadata.
- New `gc sling --formula`, API sling, formula-backed order dispatch, new
  convergence root creation, and speculative wisp creation must preflight the
  formula with the current host capability. On
  `formula.compiler_requirement_unsatisfied`, they create no root, child bead,
  or partial convergence state.
- Retrying an existing step that does not compile a new formula continues even
  if the host flag has since been disabled.
- A retry or `on_complete` action that compiles a new formula uses the current
  host capability and can fail with the shared diagnostic before creating the
  new attached molecule.
- Convergence adapters must use the same diagnostic path for create, retry,
  and speculative-wisp entry points. A failed preflight produces no active
  loop with missing children.

Required tests cover enabled and disabled host capability for CLI sling, API
sling, order-created wisps, convergence root creation, convergence retry,
scope fragments, expansion/aspect requirements, and continuation of an
already-created graph workflow after the flag is disabled.

## Consequences

- Formula consistency remains anchored at the pack revision boundary.
- The formula header declares requirements, not artifact identity and not
  runtime compiler choice.
- Existing graph-v2 formulas keep working through a measurable compatibility
  alias.
- Operators get one stable diagnostic contract across CLI, API, dashboard,
  orders, controller, and convergence.
- Implementation work is larger than a field rename because all behavioral
  consumers must move to the normalized result before first-party formulas can
  become requires-only.
